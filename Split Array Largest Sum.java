/*
    Given an array which consists of non-negative integers and an integer m, you can split the array into m non-empty 
    continuous subarrays. Write an algorithm to minimize the largest sum among these m subarrays.
    
    Note:
        Given m satisfies the following constraint: 1 ≤ m ≤ length(nums) ≤ 14,000.

    Example: 
		Input:
        nums = [1,2,3,4,5]
        m = 2

        Output:
        9

        Explanation:
        There are four ways to split nums into two subarrays.
        The best way is to split it into [1,2,3] and [4,5],
        where the largest sum among the two subarrays is only 9.

    Solution: None
