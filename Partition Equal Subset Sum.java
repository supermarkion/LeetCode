    Given a non-empty array containing only positive integers, find if the array can be partitioned into two subsets 
    such that the sum of elements in both subsets is equal.
    
    Note:
        Both the array size and each of the array element will not exceed 100.

    Example: 
        Example 1:
            Input: [1, 5, 11, 5]
            Output: true
            Explanation: The array can be partitioned as [1, 5, 5] and [11].
        
        Example 2:
            Input: [1, 2, 3, 5]
            Output: false
            Explanation: The array cannot be partitioned into equal sum subsets.

    Solution: None
