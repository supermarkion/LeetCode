/*
    Given a non-empty 2D matrix matrix and an integer k, find the max sum of a rectangle in the matrix such that its sum is no larger than k.

    Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/max-sum-of-sub-matrix-no-larger-than-k/

    Example: 
		Given matrix = [
		  [1,  0, 1],
		  [0, -2, 3]
		]
		k = 2
		The answer is 2. Because the sum of rectangle [[0, 1], [-2, 3]] is 2 and 2 is the max number no larger than k (k = 2).
