/*
    Given a binary search tree (BST) with duplicates, find all the mode(s) (the most frequently occurred element) in the given BST.

	Assume a BST is defined as follows:

	The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than or equal to the node's key.
	The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than or equal to the node's key.
	Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.

	Example: 
	
		Given BST [1,null,2,2],
		   1
		    \
		     2
		    /
		   2
		return [2].
