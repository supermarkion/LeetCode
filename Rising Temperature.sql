/*
    Given a Weather table, write a SQL query to find all dates' Ids with higher temperature compared to its previous (yesterday's) dates.
		+---------+------------+------------------+
		| Id(INT) | Date(DATE) | Temperature(INT) |
		+---------+------------+------------------+
		|       1 | 2015-01-01 |               10 |
		|       2 | 2015-01-02 |               25 |
		|       3 | 2015-01-03 |               20 |
