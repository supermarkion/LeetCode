/*
    Given integers n and k, find the lexicographically k-th smallest integer in the range from 1 to n.
    Note: 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9.

    Example: 
        Input:
        n: 13   k: 2

        Output:
        10

        Explanation:
        The lexicographical order is [1, 10, 11, 12, 13, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9], so the second smallest number is 10.

    Solution: None
