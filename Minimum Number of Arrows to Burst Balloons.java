/*
    There are a number of spherical balloons spread in two-dimensional space. For each balloon, provided 
    input is the start and end coordinates of the horizontal diameter. Since it's horizontal, y-coordinates 
    don't matter and hence the x-coordinates of start and end of the diameter suffice. Start is always smaller 
    than end. There will be at most 104 balloons.

    An arrow can be shot up exactly vertically from different points along the x-axis. A balloon with xstart 
    and xend bursts by an arrow shot at x if xstart ≤ x ≤ xend. There is no limit to the number of arrows that 
    can be shot. An arrow once shot keeps travelling up infinitely. The problem is to find the minimum number of 
    arrows that must be shot to burst all balloons.

    Example: 
        Input:
        [[10,16], [2,8], [1,6], [7,12]]

        Output:
        2

        Explanation:
        One way is to shoot one arrow for example at x = 6 (bursting the balloons [2,8] and [1,6]) and another arrow at x = 11 (bursting the other two balloons).

    Solution: None
