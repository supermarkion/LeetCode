/*
    A binary watch has 4 LEDs on the top which represent the hours (0-11), and the 6 LEDs on the bottom represent the minutes (0-59).
	
	Each LED represents a zero or one, with the least significant bit on the right.
	
	For example, the above binary watch reads "3:25". Given a non-negative integer n which represents the number of LEDs that are currently 
	on, return all possible times the watch could represent.
