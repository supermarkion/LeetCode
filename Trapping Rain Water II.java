    Example: 
		Given the following 3x6 height map:
		[
		  [1,4,3,1,3,2],
		  [3,2,1,3,2,4],
		  [2,3,3,2,3,1]
		]

		The above image represents the elevation map [[1,4,3,1,3,2],[3,2,1,3,2,4],[2,3,3,2,3,1]] before the rain.
		After the rain, water are trapped between the blocks. The total volume of water trapped is 4.
		Return 4.

    Solution: None
